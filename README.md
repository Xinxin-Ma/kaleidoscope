# kaleidoscope

This project was built on the MVC model which provided by Dr. Dave Matuszek and modified by Dr. Swapneel Sheth at University of Pennsylvania as an assignment.

All GUI design and implementation are done by Xinxin Ma. It is a Java/Swing interactive kaleidoscope. The basic functions include running the kaleidoscope and stopping it, clearing all the shapes on the screen and restarting, changing colors of all the shapes and changing folding number of the shapes and modifying the speed of all the shapes. It is inside a re-sizable JFrame-based GUI.

The original kaleidoscope:
